I used Google DataStudio for Data Visualization 
I tried to connect to the Three result files on google Clout Platform but i could't find how
So i made Data Visualization and build my Dashboard on the Original Table Created on Google BigQuery
I Build my DataSet on Table [Twitter.Twitter_UserTweets] that Created before on Google BigQuery 
Then
I made some Aggregations on the Fields and used most of Avaliable Graphs, Charts, Tables and  Filteration to Visualize my work as Screenshots attached
